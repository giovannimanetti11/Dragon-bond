## Description
Dragon-bond is an interactive browser game that simulates the Tenkaichi tournament featuring Dragon Ball characters. Each character has their own "Power Level" and special skills. 
Users can control a character, choosing to attack or defend in real time.

## Features
- **Random fighter selection**: fighters are randomly assigned for each match.
- **Special attacks and defense**: each fighter has special skills and the ability to defend, which allows them to recover health and energy (and get less damage from the next attack received).
- **Realistic sound and avatars**: sounds are reproduced for many skills, and each character has its own avatar.
- **Elimination tournament**: the game proceeds in an elimination-style tournament, where winners advance to the final.
